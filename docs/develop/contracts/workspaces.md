NEAR Workspaces is a library for automating workflows and writing tests for NEAR smart contracts.
You can use it as is or integrate with test runner of your choise (AVA, Jest, Mocha, etc.). If you don't have a preference, we suggest you to use AVA.

## Overview

Controlled, concurrent workspaces in local NEAR Sandbox blockchains or on NEAR TestNet. Fun, deterministic testing and powerful scripting for NEAR.



Write tests once, run them both on NEAR TestNet and a controlled NEAR Sandbox local environment 

## Libraries

The same Workspaces interface is supported by libraries for the following languages:

- TypeScript/JavaScript: `workspaces-js`
- Rust: `workspaces-rs`
